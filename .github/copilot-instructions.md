## Expected Behavior from Copilot
### Preserve Existing Code
The current codebase is the source of truth and must be respected. Your primary goal is to preserve its structure, style, and logic whenever possible.

### Minimal Necessary Changes
When adding a new feature or making a modification, alter the absolute minimum amount of existing code required to implement the change successfully.

### Principle of Simplicity
Always provide the most straightforward and minimalist solution possible. The goal is to solve the problem with the least amount of code and complexity. Avoid premature optimization or over-engineering.
