# General
Whenever possible, use recursion.

Anytime someone asks about the business logic diagram, utilize the [Business Logic Diagram](../diag.mmd).

# Rust
Do not suggest using any external packages (i.e., dependencies). All rust code should only use the `std` library.

# Python
Always write my Python unit tests using `pytest`, not `unittest`.

# .NET
When suggesting .NET code, only suggest code compatible with .NET 8.
Always write my .NET unit tests using `Xunit`.
