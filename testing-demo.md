- "I'm looking to write unit tests for this app but i need to be sure they are comprehensive and have as close to 100% test coverage as possible. Can you help me thing through corner cases and uncommon scenarios I may need to test here? I want to log all of them in a file somewhere"
- save to file (i.e., do not start implementation, use other button)
- run prompt file
