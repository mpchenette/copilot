# Proving Copilot's Value

First off, ESSP.

## Key Metrics
- Developer Happiness
- Development Speed
- Code Quality

## Developer Happiness

## Development Speed
What metrics do you track today? How do you track development speed today? We need a baseline from which to compare Copilot. If we don't have one, how will we know if there is improvement?

## Code Quality
<!-- add hover tooltips to column titles. for how hard is it to game: "how difficult would it be for developers to skew the metric in a way that makes them look favorable with no true change? the harder the better" -->

metric | how good a representation of CQ is it? | how easy is it to grab? | how objective is it? | how hard is it to game?
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
bugs / capita | 8 | 5 | 10 | 10
code quality tool score / rating | 8 | 8 | 7 | 9
average time to merge PR | 5 | 8 | 7 | 5
average number of comments on a PR | 7 | 10 | 6 | 4
\# of code related outages / year (or downtime due to) | 8 | 7 | 10 | 10
average age of a LoC? - 2 (extremely easy to track accurately) - subjective / very much depends on how you interpret it
average onboard / onramp time - 2 (also hard to track accurately) - very subjective / hard to know what "good" is here. will very much depend on the codebase / language /etc.


## Key Things To Remember
- Pitfalls (common, gameable metrics that lead to anti-patterns)
- You will not see the value overnight. It will take months of sustained rollout, engagement and tracking metrics to begin to see the improvements Copilot brings.
