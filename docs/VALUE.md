# Proving Copilot's Value

First off, ESSP.

## Key Metrics
- Developer Happiness
- Development Speed
- Code Quality

## Developer Happiness

## Development Speed
What metrics do you track today? How do you track development speed today? We need a baseline from which to compare Copilot. If we don't have one, how will we know if there is improvement?

## Code Quality
bugs / capita - 8
code quality tool score / rating - 8
average time to merge PR - 5
average number of comments on a PR - 7
\# of code related outages / year (or downtime due to) - 8
average age of a LoC? - 2


## Key Things To Remember
- Pitfalls (common, gameable metrics that lead to anti-patterns)
- You will not see the value overnight. It will take months of sustained rollout, engagement and tracking metrics to begin to see the improvements Copilot brings.
